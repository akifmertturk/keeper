Keeper is a front-end project that the user can take notes and list them.  
I built this app to demonstrate what I know about React and what I can do with it.  
This is an example project on Udemy course _the-complete-web-development-bootcamp_ by Angela Yu. I have completed this course, while I taking this course, I succesfully completed all challanges and this Keeper is one of them.
